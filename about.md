I am Daniel Galvão and I was born in Lorena, São Paulo. I graduated from UNISANTOS with a bachelor’s degree in System Analysis and have been working with web development since 2010.

I worked with developing hotsites and improvements in applications at Vagalume.com.br for 4 years. Vagalume is a Brazilian big portal of song lyrics, translations and video clips.

After pursuing new challenges, I was called to work at JustDigital, where the focus is to build large content portals to large customers with the use of Drupal CMS. We, however, have freedom to choose any type of applications, tools, operating systems, and any framework or library to assist the front-end and the back-end.

The work process at JustDigital is Scrum and Agile based, with sprints, pair programing, code review, tests, and daily. All processes involve the best of Agile, aligned with Continuous Delivery.

I am currently almost 30 years old, and I have challenges every day, which makes me happy and is aligned with a lot of study and application of new technologies.

My goal is to work out of Brazil for the JustDigital, Starting a new life. Until the challenges are others to motivate me. As a product, or a big company with its own product.

Nowadays my interests are: React, Meteor, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, CSS, PHP, Python, ElasticSearch and DevOps.

My hobbies are learning new things, staying with my family - wife, son and dog, and visiting new places, cities and countries.

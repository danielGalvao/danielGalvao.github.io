I am Daniel Galvão, born in Lorena, São Paulo. Graduated in Information Systems at UNISANTOS, working with web development since 2010.

I worked at vagalume.com.br for 4 years. A big portal of music lyrics, developing hotsites and improvements in applications to show lyrics and videos. After desire for new challenges I was called to work at JustDigital, where the focus is large customers with large portals content.

Working with CMS Drupal. But we have freedom of choice of the entire application, which tool to use, operating system and any framework or library to assist the front-end and the back-end. The processes of work is scrum and agile based, with sprints, pair programing, code review, tests, daily and all processes involving the best of agile. Aligned with continuous integrations.

Today I'm almost 30 years old, and I have challenge every day. It makes me very well and walks lined with lot of study and applying new technologies.

My goal is to work out of Brazil, at Just to start a new life, until the challenges that motivate me are other. I want to work with a product, or a big company with its own product.

My interests today are: React, Meteor, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, CSS, PHP, Python and ElasticSearch.

My fun is learning something new, stay with my family, wife, son and dog. See new places, cities and countries.

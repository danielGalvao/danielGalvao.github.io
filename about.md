My name is Daniel Galvão and I was born in Lorena, São Paulo. I graduated from UNISANTOS with a bachelor’s degree in System Analysis and I have been working with web development since 2010.

I worked with developing hotsites and improvements in applications at vagalume.com.br for 4 years. Vagalume is a big brazilian portal of song lyrics, translations and video clips.

After looking for new challenges, I was called to work at JUST, where the focus of the company is to build large content portals to large customers with the use of Drupal CMS. We, however, have the freedom to choose any type of applications, tools, operating systems, and any framework or library to assist the front-end and the back-end.

The work process at JustDigital is Scrum and Agile based, with sprints, pair programing, code review, tests, and daily. All processes involve the best of Agile, aligned with Continuous Delivery.

I am currently almost 30 years old, and I face new challenges at work every day, and I am happy to study new technologies and applications to overcome those challenges.

My goal is to work outside of Brazil for the JUST, and start a new life, until I’m faced with new challenges and goals that motivate me, whether it's a product, or a big company with it's own product.

Nowadays my interests are: React, Meteor, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, CSS, PHP, Python, ElasticSearch and DevOps.

My hobbies are learning new things, staying with my family - wife, son and dog, and visiting new places, cities and countries.
